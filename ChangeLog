2014-10-03 Matt:
	* Updating main to take option of rotation angle for ice
	* Removing the corner check.  This seems obsolete and was causing some errors.
	* Tagging version 00.03 -- NEVER TAGGED 00.02!  Changing to version 00.02
	* Adding the option to be able to input non-integar steps (so can use floating point)

2014-09-30 Matt:
	* Adding testing file test.C in order to check geometry

2014-09-26 Matt:
	* Added options for running different angles
	* Found some odd bug at angle 110 -- Just stops after two iterations(?)

2014-09-25 Matt:
	* Fixed the bugs due to reflection and refraction at each boundary (I think).
	* Only works for angles 0-90, then it gets confused.  This should be fixed in future!
	* Tagging version.00.00.01
	* Fixed > 90 degree issue.  Now ok for angles 0-180 degree. Had to do with reflections
	* Added reflection method to physics
	* Cleaning up printouts
	* Tagging version.00.00.02
	* For future try to consolidate reflective and refractive methods.

2014-09-24 Matt:
	* Fixed one bug dealing with exiting angle when rotating.
	* Found another issue due with activeSide and the equations list.
	* Consider re-writing now that have better idea of how to handle each case.

2014-09-12 Matt:
	* Committing fix for the 55 angle
	* Still bugs when rotate iceblock. Main issue is refracted angle not in same coord system.

2014-09-11 Matt:
	* Committing working version with a few bugs
	* There is one error that has to do with how you cycle between the sides of the cube.
	  The issue happens at 55 degrees right now, where you get many TIR at the same angle.
	  Fix tomorrow/later

2014-09-10 Matt:
	* RayTracer created. The other programs found were more complicated than needed.
	* Adding basic structure I have thought of so far.
	* Adding skeleton of main to create a window and the ice block.
	* Adding code for the ice block
